# DGME-and-DBME-Algorithms

This repository gives the implementation of the DGME and DBME algorithms from the paper _Deep Backward and Galerkin Methods for Learning Finite State Master Equations_ by Asaf Cohen, Mathieu Lauri√®re and Ethan Zell. Specfically, the code given here pertains to Example 7.1 in the paper.

_The DBME_Simple and DGME_Simple notebooks are ready-to-run notebooks with a limited visualization component. For any curious reader, this will likely be all you need._ 

For the remaining description of this repository and the full information for the visualizations in the paper:

The full notebooks containing all visualizations from the paper can be found in Full_Notebooks folder. Recall from the paper that the DGME output is a single neural network while the output from the DBME is a "mesh" of neural networks along a given partition of the time interval $[0,T]$.

At the end of each file in Full_Notebooks are visualization classes that were used to create the graphs from the paper. The models used to create the graphs are also included in this repository. 

The folder Most_Models contains all the relevant DGME models and three DBME models (those with the smaller associated partition steps); the restriction is because the number of neural networks becomes large as the partition size increases. The remaining two DBME results are in .zip format within the All_Models_Zipped folder. As the name implies, All_Models_Zipped also contains all other models in zipped format.

The DGME models have the substring "dgm" in the name, while the DBME neural network meshes have "mesh" in the name. 

To use the visualization classes most effectively, download the Most_Models folder and place the DBME and DGME in the same directory. Then change the "LOCAL PATH" substring as appropriate, uncomment those lines at the end of the notebooks, and run the cells to see the visualizations for the models given in the paper. To use all models, do the same with the All_Models_Zipped folder and unzip the folders within before repeating the process.
